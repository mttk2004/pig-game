# Dice Game

This is a simple dice game implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the game interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the game interface.
- `.prettierrc`: The configuration file for Prettier, a code formatter used in this project.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. The game is played with two players in rounds.
3. In each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their round score.
4. But, if the player rolls a 1, all their round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
5. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their round score gets added to their global score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
6. The first player to reach 100 points on the global score wins the game.
7. To start a new game, click the 'New Game' button.

## Development

To make changes to the game, modify the `script.js` or `style.css` files as needed. Use Prettier to format your code for consistency.
